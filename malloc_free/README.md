# Malloc and Free

This directory contains C programs that use dynamic memory allocation with `malloc` and `free`.

## Files

- `0-create_array.c`: Contains a function that creates an array of chars, and initializes it with a specific char.
- `1-strdup.c`: Contains a function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter.
- `2-str_concat.c`: Contains a function that concatenates two strings.
- `3-alloc_grid.c`: Contains a function that returns a pointer to a 2 dimensional array of integers.
- `4-free_grid.c`: Contains a function that frees a 2 dimensional grid previously created by the `alloc_grid` function.
- `0-main.c`, `1-main.c`, `2-main.c`, `3-main.c`, `4-main.c`: Contains the main function for each corresponding program.
- `_putchar.c`: Contains a function that writes a character to the standard output.
- `main.h`: Contains header file declarations for the programs.

## Usage

To use these functions in your own program, include the `main.h` header file and compile your program with the corresponding `.c` files.
