# Function Pointers

This directory contains C programs that use function pointers.

## Files

- `0-print_name.c`: Contains a function that prints a name using a function pointer.
- `1-array_iterator.c`: Contains a function that executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array.
- `2-int_index.c`: Contains a function that searches for an integer in an array using a function pointer.
- `3-calc.h`: Contains header file declarations for a program that performs simple arithmetic operations.
- `3-get_op_func.c`: Contains a function that selects the correct function to perform the operation asked by the user.
- `3-main.c`: Contains the main function for a program that performs simple arithmetic operations.
- `3-op_functions.c`: Contains functions that perform simple arithmetic operations.
- `function_pointers.h`: Contains header file declarations for the programs.

## Usage

To use these functions in your own program, include the `function_pointers.h` header file and compile your program with the corresponding `.c` files. For example:
