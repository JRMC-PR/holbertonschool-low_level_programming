# Doubly Linked Lists

This directory contains C programs that use doubly linked lists.

## Files

- `0-print_dlistint.c`: Contains a function that prints all the elements of a doubly linked list.
- `1-dlistint_len.c`: Contains a function that returns the number of elements in a doubly linked list.
- `2-add_dnodeint.c`: Contains a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a doubly linked list.
- `3-add_dnodeint_end.c`: Contains a function that adds a new node at the end of a doubly linked list.
- `4-free_dlistint.c`: Contains a function that frees a doubly linked list.
- `5-get_dnodeint.c`: Contains a function that returns the nth node of a doubly linked list.
- `6-sum_dlistint.c`: Contains a function that returns the sum of all the data (n) of a doubly linked list.
- `7-insert_dnodeint.c`: Contains a function that inserts a new node at a given position in a doubly linked list.
- `8-delete_dnodeint.c`: Contains a function that deletes a node at a given position in a doubly linked list.
- `lists.h`: Contains header file declarations for the programs.

## Usage

To use these functions in your own program, include the `lists.h` header file and compile your program with the corresponding `.c` files.
