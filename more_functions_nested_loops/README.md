# More Functions and Nested Loops

This directory contains C programs that use more functions and nested loops.

## Files

- `0-isupper.c`: Contains a function that checks for uppercase characters.
- `1-isdigit.c`: Contains a function that checks for a digit (0 through 9).
- `2-mul.c`: Contains a function that multiplies two integers.
- `3-print_numbers.c`: Contains a function that prints the numbers from 0 to 9.
- `4-print_most_numbers.c`: Contains a function that prints the numbers from 0 to 9, except for 2 and 4.
- `5-more_numbers.c`: Contains a function that prints the numbers from 0 to 14, ten times.
- `6-print_line.c`: Contains a function that draws a straight line in the terminal.
- `7-diagonals`: Contains a function that prints a diagonal line of n length.
- `7-main.c`: Contains the main function for the `7-diagonals` program.
- `8-print_square.c`: Contains a function that prints a square.
- `8-main.c`: Contains the main function for the `8-print_square` program.
- `9-fizz_buzz.c`: Contains a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number, for multiples of five, print "Buzz", and for multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz".
- `10-print_triangle.c`: Contains a function that prints a triangle.
- `_putchar.c`: Contains a function that writes a character to the standard output.
- `main.h`: Contains header file declarations for the programs.

## Usage

To use these functions in your own program, include the `main.h` header file and compile your program with the corresponding `.c` files.
